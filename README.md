- View original version of any image/video anytime
- Four visibility categories: Public, Friends, Close Friends, Private
- Like, comment, and interact with others' posts
- Dashboard with organized folder-style view
- Grid layout on dashboards, feed with full dimensions
- Search for users or posts
- Light/dark mode, profile customization
- Notifications for likes, comments, and uploads
- Admin roles for content moderation and platform updates

## Technologies (Planned)

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
